                <h1>Unity Jojo's Bizzare Adventure Fighting Game</h1>
                <p>
                    This is my best project listed on the page. My biggest dream as a kid was to create a video-game and I got the chance to do that when I joined PTEC. I spent over 100 hours of coding and editing the game because I wanted to recreate the arcade game on my laptop. This game is part of an animated franchise that has growwn so big over time. The anime, Jojo's Bizzare Adventure, follows generations of the Joestar familys fight against threats to humanity, ranging from vapires, serial killers, priests, etc. They have a power known as a stand. A stand is a physical representation of your soul and spirit. Depending on who you are, this manifestation is made based on your image, giving you powers that would fit you as a person. I had gotten so interested in this interesting franchise and found out they released a game in the late 80's for the Sega Dreamcast. I checked it out and chose to recreate it right away for my upcoming project. 
                </p>
                <p>The creation of the game took many days. I went through many tutorials on creating moving script. The most difficult part of it all was finding the assets for the game. I had to source them myself from many online videos since i didnt have a physical copy of the game to inspect. I also had a big issue with animating the characters since there was so many animations to implement. I ended being able to finish the game and having it playable. My next steps are to have it included with the original story mode and be able to play it on my console.  I learnt that patience does bring the best outcome because I encountered many setbacks and difficulties when coding the game, but my perseverance helped me make the game and learn how to deal with a problem on my own. I am very proud of this project because I did something I wouldn't expect myself to do and did something that I loved as a school project</p>
